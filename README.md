# AndroidComponents
This projects is to show the main Android components and the way they works.

I did this project to get a better understanding for my post:

You can explore the code to know how each component is created and works.

Activity. Contains the methods for the lifecycle. You can add breakpoints to see the activation of each part of the lifecycle.

Service. This is a simple example of a started service and a Bind service. You can change the code and add breakpoints to explore how it works.

Broadcast Receiver. This example contains a receiver for system events and other for custom events. Custom events could work to comunicate between threads or services.

Content Providers. In this example we share the information from our internal DB to other apps.

Maybe this project contains some design errors. I did it to be understandable and with the less code spaguethi possible. I tried to understand what I did in each step to be easier to you understand it. If there is any doubt don't hesitate in contact me.

I hope this project helps to understand the main components in android.
