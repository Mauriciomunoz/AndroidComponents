# AndroidComponents
This projects is to show the main Android components and the way they works.

You can explore the code to know how each component is created and works.

Activity contains the methods for the lifecycle. You can add breakpoints to see the activation of each part of the lifecycle.

This works is unfinished and I will be adding more components in the next days.
